# Background-Subtraction-
Sample background values at each pixel are quantized into codebooks which represent a compressed form of background model for a long image sequence. The CB algorithm adopts a quantization/clustering technique, to construct a background model. Samples at each pixel are clustered into the set of codewords. The background is encoded on a pixel by pixel basis.
